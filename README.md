# AttendanceManagementSystem
Attendance Management System for Higher Institutions.

This system is designed to streamline attendance tracking in higher institutions using a secure and efficient QR code-based approach. Lecturers can generate time-limited QR codes for each session, allowing students to mark their attendance by scanning the code. The system ensures authenticity by preventing unauthorized attendance marking and provides real-time attendance records. Lecturers can generate reports, enhancing transparency and efficiency in attendance management.
